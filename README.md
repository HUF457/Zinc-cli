Zinc is a terminal for Windows 10/11, designed for developers who want a clean, efficient, and highly integrated command-line workspace. It pairs a deliberate vertical-tab layout with a focused feature set—powerful where it matters, quiet where it does not.

## Design Philosophy

Zinc is built on a clear set of principles:

*   **Simplicity by Design:** A terminal should be powerful yet uncluttered. Zinc ships the essentials and refuses the rest.
*   **Aesthetic Integration:** A frameless Acrylic-style window and a vertical tab rail that feels at home on a modern Windows desktop.
*   **Local-First Privacy:** Zero analytics telemetry. Settings, session metadata, and pasted images stay on your machine. Optional update checks contact GitHub Releases only.

## Key Features

*   **Vertical Tab Bar:** Manage many sessions with full names visible—no guessing behind ellipses.
*   **Automatic Shell Detection:** PowerShell 7, Windows PowerShell, CMD, Git Bash, and installed WSL distributions.
*   **Modern Aesthetics:** Frameless Acrylic-style chrome, themes, and opacity controls.
*   **Deep Customization:** Fonts, colors, shortcuts, zoom, scrollback, and more.
*   **Session Persistence:** Restore tab order and working directories after a restart.
*   **Intelligent Interaction:**
    *   **Clickable Links:** Open URLs in your system browser.
    *   **Image Paste:** Paste clipboard images as local paths into the active terminal.
    *   **Continuation Assistance:** A local-only helper that can type `claude --continue` or `grok --continue` for you—no AI core, no upload of terminal content.
*   **Optional Updates:** Quiet checks against GitHub Releases when enabled.
*   **Multilingual UI:** English and Simplified Chinese.

## What Zinc Will Not Do

To maintain its focus on being a lean and fast terminal, Zinc deliberately avoids certain features:

*   Cloud Sync & User Accounts
*   Plugin Marketplace or Extension APIs
*   Split Panes (focus is on tab/window management)
*   Built-in SSH Profile Management

## Installation

1.  Navigate to the [**official website**](https://zincli.org) or the [**Releases**](https://github.com/HUF457/Zinc-cli/releases/latest) page.
2.  Download the `Zinc-0.6.6-Setup.exe` installer.
3.  Run the installer.

> **Note on Windows SmartScreen:**
> The application is not code-signed. As a result, Windows SmartScreen will likely display a warning. To proceed, click "More info" and then "Run anyway".
>
> To verify the integrity of the installer, you can compare its SHA256 hash with the one provided in `SHA256SUMS` on the release page. Open PowerShell and run the following command:
>
> ```powershell
> Get-FileHash .\Zinc-0.6.6-Setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
> ```

## Privacy and Security

Zinc is designed with your privacy as a top priority.

*   **Zero Telemetry:** The application collects no analytics or usage data.
*   **Local Data Storage:** All settings, session metadata, and pasted image data are stored exclusively on your local machine.
*   **Network Activity:**
    *   Zinc itself only connects to the internet to check for updates from the GitHub Releases API, an optional feature.
    *   The terminal subprocesses (e.g., PowerShell, WSL, curl) can access the network as they normally would.
*   **No AI, No Uploads:** The session continuation feature is a simple command-typing macro and does not involve any AI models or upload your terminal contents.
