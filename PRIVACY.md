# Privacy

[简体中文](PRIVACY.zh-CN.md) | English

This document describes the data boundary of the official Zinc source tree and
builds made from it. Modified distributions may behave differently.

## Data Zinc Stores Locally

Zinc uses Electron's per-user `userData` directory to store:

- application settings;
- session-restore metadata, including tab order and working directories;
- clipboard images pasted into a terminal, under a `PastedImages` directory.

Pasted images are given an absolute local path that Zinc types into the active
terminal. On startup, Zinc attempts to remove only regular files in its own
`PastedImages` directory that are more than 30 days old. Cleanup can be delayed
if Zinc is not started or a file cannot be accessed. Uninstalling Zinc may
preserve the whole user-data directory so a reinstall can retain settings.

These files can reveal private paths, shell choices, images, and work context.
They are not intended for source control or public bug reports.

## Local process inspection for session restore

When session restore and optional AI conversation resume are enabled, Zinc may
inspect the process tree of a terminal tab on a short running-app interval and
again at quit, to record whether Claude, Codex, or Grok Build was running and
which working directory to restore. Tab-list changes rewrite the local snapshot
without repeating that process-tree scan. The inspection is local and does not
upload results. Turning off session restore or AI conversation resume reduces
what is recorded.

## Network Activity

Zinc does not include analytics, advertising telemetry, or a user account
service. A packaged Windows build contacts GitHub Releases once shortly after
startup to look for a newer version (so the update badge can appear without
opening Settings), and again when the user checks for or downloads an update
from Settings → About or the update dialog. Updates download automatically when
found; installing still requires an explicit restart action. Web links are
opened in the system browser after scheme validation.

Terminal commands, shells, developer tools, and child processes run by the user
are separate programs and may access the network according to their own
configuration and privacy policies. A path or value typed into such a program
is then handled by that program, not by Zinc's network code.

## Diagnostic Information

Zinc does not automatically upload terminal output, command history, settings,
session state, screenshots, or crash dumps. If a user voluntarily posts these
items to GitHub, GitHub's privacy terms apply and the content may become public.

Before sharing diagnostics, remove usernames, local and network paths, command
history, process command lines, environment variables, tokens, cookies,
hostnames, IP addresses, repository names, images, and document contents. A
minimal textual reproduction is preferred over a full screenshot or settings
file.

## Windows Terminal Settings Examples

The repository contains only a synthetic example. A developer may create a
local Windows Terminal settings snapshot for testing, but the real snapshot is
ignored by Git and must never be committed.

## Your Choices

- Disable session restore if working-directory persistence is unwanted.
- Disable AI conversation resume if local process-tree inspection for
  Claude/Codex/Grok resume commands is unwanted.
- Delete pasted images and Zinc's local user-data directory when they are no
  longer needed; do not rely on startup cleanup for urgent deletion.
- Prefer a development (unpackaged) build if you do not want Zinc to contact
  GitHub Releases on startup; packaged builds perform one quiet update check.
- Review child-process privacy settings independently of Zinc.

Privacy-sensitive defects should be reported privately using
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
