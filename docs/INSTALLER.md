# Installer

Zinc ships a single Windows distribution: an **NSIS** setup built by
electron-builder from `app/package.json`.

## Build

Run from `app/`:

```powershell
npm run dist
```

That produces `app/dist/Zinc-<version>-Setup.exe` (plus the auto-updater
blockmap and `latest.yml`).

The setup targets Windows x64, installs per user by default, can create Desktop
and Start menu shortcuts, and preserves user data during uninstall.

## Silent install and uninstall

NSIS silent flags:

```powershell
# Install or overwrite the same version
.\Zinc-<version>-Setup.exe /S

# Uninstall via the registry QuietUninstallString (electron-builder writes one),
# typically:
#   "…\Uninstall Zinc.exe" /currentuser /S
```

## Verification

After installing on Windows:

```powershell
pwsh ./app/scripts/verify-install.ps1 -ExpectedVersion 0.6.1
```

For the complete acceptance matrix (clean install, overwrite, reinstall,
optional upgrade, final uninstall, and a packaged PowerShell terminal smoke):

```powershell
pwsh ./app/scripts/verify-installer-matrix.ps1 `
  -SetupPath ./app/dist/Zinc-0.6.1-Setup.exe `
  -ExpectedVersion 0.6.1
```

Add `-PreviousSetupPath` with a reviewed older setup (and
`-PreviousExpectedVersion`) to exercise upgrade.

The matrix must confirm:

- clean install creates the application, uninstall entry, and expected shortcuts;
- overwrite and reinstall leave a usable installation of the expected version;
- upgrade replaces the older displayed version when a baseline is supplied;
- every installed state launches the packaged application, starts its PowerShell
  terminal, and returns a command marker through the rendered xterm surface;
- operations against a running Zinc force-close it first (NSIS does not host a
  second-instance quit UI);
- uninstall removes application files, shortcuts, and uninstall entry while
  preserving documented user data.

The matrix creates a unique marker under `%APPDATA%\zinc`, verifies that the
marker survives every install/uninstall transition, and restores or removes only
that marker in `finally`. Packaged-app CDP data is isolated under the ignored
`app/dist/installer-matrix-runtime/` directory. Run the matrix on a dedicated
Windows test account or disposable VM: it starts and stops Zinc processes and
finishes with Zinc uninstalled.

By default a clipboard image goes straight to the foreground AI CLI, which
reads the clipboard itself, and no file is written. Only in the fallback (a
plain shell, WSL, or the Image paste setting set to file) is the image saved to
`PastedImages`. Those files are user data. Zinc accepts only supported image MIME
types with matching file structure, enforces a 25 MiB limit again in the main
service, and removes regular files older than 30 days only from its own
`PastedImages` directory at startup. Uninstall does not delete the rest of the
Zinc user-data directory.

## Release Safety

Do not commit generated setup executables, signing material, or local
verification logs. Release assets are generated in CI or a clean Windows build
environment and published with checksums.
